# CZ3001 : Advanced Computer Architecture

## Learning Outcome
After completing the course, I have gained excellent understanding of **pipelining** and its implementation in assembly language and different types of **parallelism** and their **strengths and weaknesses**.

## Coursework Assignment
- modified the ``4-stage pipelined processor`` to include ``load word (lw)`` and ``store word(sw)`` instructions
- transformed it into a ``5 stage pipelined processor``
- analyzed the operation of 5 stage pipelined data path and 
- ``simulated`` the LW and sw instructions along with rtype and addi instructions 

## Knowledge Accquired includes: 

1.	Overview of basic computer architecture

2.	Instruction Set Architecture Design

3.	Micro-architecture Design

4.	Memory Systems and I/O Design

5.	Instruction-Level Parallelism

6.	Data-Level Parallelism

7.	Thread-Level Parallelism

8.	Emerging Computing Trends
