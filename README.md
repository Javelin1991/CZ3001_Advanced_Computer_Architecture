# CZ3001 : Advanced Computer Architecture

## Brief Description
After completing the course, I have gained excellent understanding of **pipelining** and its implementation in assembly language and different types of **parallelism** and their **strengths and weaknesses**.

## Coursework Assignment
Implementation of code for a given set of data structure related questions. Tasks include implementation of : 

- a function that aims to ``sort`` the items in the ``linkedlist`` in the ascending order.
- a function that aims to move all the odd items in a linkedlist to the back and the even items, to the front
- a function that aims to ``create`` a ``Queue`` based on the items from a linkedlist. 
- a function that aims to remove all the odd items from the Queue
- a function that aims to print the items in a ``Binary Search Tree`` in post-order manner by using ``iterative method`` with ``two stacks``
